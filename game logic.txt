    // player is given a url link to invite an opponent -- AND -- option of just ROOM ID and website link
        // url contains ROOMID 

// Player One has loading screen -- "Waiting on Player Two"
    //Player One sends signal to Player Two that they are ready, waits on reply from Player Two 

// Player Two goes to given URL -- OR -- goes to normal site and enters ROOMID -> Join Game
    (php IP address set to player two)
    // url to load game -- EITHER -- load game straight away and send ready signal -- OR -- prefill value in ROOMID field, disable 'Start' button, have to click join to play.
    // Sends signal to Player One that they are ready. 
        // Waits on/checks for signal from Player One that they are ready.

// both players are ready
    // splash screen is removed
        // player one's turn first
          **// msg in obvious place for Player Two that they are waiting for Player One to take their turn
        // move is played

                    // on win, winning player is shown winning banner, loser, losing banner

            // player one is waiting on player Two's move

        // player two moves, repeats from** with oposite players

RESET BUTTON
// at any point either player can reset the game
    // forced -- OR -- both players agree?
        // board object is reset to empty
        // all board discs are removed
        // set currentPlayer to whoever didn't start last time.
            ( have to set variable startingPlayer and switch at the end of each game or reset)
            ( previousPlayer set to opposite of currentPlayer)
        // other variables may need to be reset also
        
QUIT BUTTON
// disconnects player from game and sends quit message to opponent
    // takes player back to splash screen
    // pop up msg for opponent
        // on press of 'ok' takes them back to splash screen

ON RELOAD
// would prefer to be able to keep game in play in case of accidental reload
    // would require board variable to be saved to json file constantly instead of relying on updating one ID on each move

POTENTIAL CHAT OPTION
// use something like kiwirc for irc based chat. 
// both players would have to agree to it
// potential security issue for unsuspecting players? 

POTENTIAL ON GOING TALLY
// track how many wins each player has over numerous games in one session
